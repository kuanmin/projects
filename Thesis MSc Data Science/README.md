    - Master Thesis - **Revisiting Ensembles for Knowledge Graph Embeddings**
    - We study the ensembles in KGEs with better trained baselines. Additionally, fine-tune and joint learning were further experimented on ensembles. The study shows that, although ensembles generally outperformed single KGE models with better trained baselines, fine-tuning has shown minor progress comparing to established ensembles. Also, the approaches by joint learning lead to outputs inferior to established ensembles with the same training specification.
    - Open source LibKGE framework is a PyTorch-based library for efficient training, evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization of [knowledge graph embeddings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8047276) (KGE). The key goal is to foster reproducible research into (as well as meaningful comparisons between) KGE models and training methods. As the authors argue in [ICLR 2020 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkxSmlBFvr), the choice of training strategy and hyperparameters are very influential on model performance, often more so than the model class itself.
    - I implement new functions to LibKGE, which will allow the New package to run training and validation, not just on single KGE model, but *multiple models* in one process, so to be able to performe **joint training** and **alternative training models**.
