 - [Information Retrieval on NLTK corpora](https://github.com/kuanmin/projects/tree/master/LSI) (`Python`) <br />
   - In this project, we discusses the implementation of a **Latent Semantic Indexing**-based information retrieval model, and evaluates its performance against the **Vector Space Model** on a collection with 18,828 documents.

 - [Automated ICD Coding](https://github.com/kuanmin/projects/tree/master/LSI) (`Python`) <br />
   - To reduce coding errors and cost, this is my attempt applying **Latent Semantic Indexing** to build an ICD coding machine which automatically and accurately translates
the free-text diagnosis descriptions into ICD codes.

 - [Recipe Finder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10a75TzSMbRbXZJtyzNDduypMRhvqyRve?usp=sharing) (`Java`, `RDFS`, `SPARQL`, `JavaScript` / *Apache Jena*) <br />
   - Apache Jena, a Java framework, is a well-known Semantic Web programming framework. In this project, data knowledge related to **Linked Open Data** and **Ontology engineering** are applied. 
   - We build an API using Apache Jena providing households with an easy way to find recipes incorporating food they need to either consume today or throw away tomorrow. We tapped into the power of the Semantic Web and developed an application which allows its users to browse recipes based on leftovers they might have in their kitchen, ultimately reducing food waste.

 - [Data & Matrix](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10a75TzSMbRbXZJtyzNDduypMRhvqyRve?usp=sharing) (`R`) <br />
   - In these tasks, data analytical skills related to **Matrix Completion**, **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization**, and **Singular Value Decomposition** are applied.

 - [Integrating Web Data on Video Games and Companies](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10a75TzSMbRbXZJtyzNDduypMRhvqyRve?usp=sharing) (`Python`, `Java`, `XML` / *MapForce*) <br />
   - In this project, we worked with Python and Java libraries BeautifulSoup, Selenium WebDriver, and Jsoup3. And data analytical skills related to **Data Translation**, **Identity Resolution**, and **Data Fusion** are applied.
   - We focus on building an integrated database of video games and video game developers which will be informative to video game players and professionals working in the industry alike. Our combined data can offer interesting new visions that can assist on business decision making and drive video game businesses to a success. Simply by exploring and mining this data, one will be able to gain a better understanding of current video game trends. 
   - For example, our integrated data can provide answers on manifold questions such as ‘Which game platform currently generates the most revenue?’, ‘Which genre types are most popular among the users?’, ’How does game experts’ judgment affect the market sales‘, or ‘How does the revenue of games differ from the worldwide regions?’.
