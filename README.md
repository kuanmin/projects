[Latent Semantic Indexing](https://github.com/kuanmin/projects/tree/master/LSI) (Python) <br />
In this project, we discusses the implementation of a LSI-based (latent semantic indexing) information retrieval model, and evaluates its performance against the traditional vector space model (VSM) on a collection with 18,828 documents.


[Recipe Finder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10a75TzSMbRbXZJtyzNDduypMRhvqyRve?usp=sharing) (JavaScript, Apache Jena Fuseki) <br />
Apache Jena Fuseki, 
In this project, we build an API providing households with an easy way to nd recipes incorporating food they need to either consume today or throw away tomorrow. We tapped into the power of the Semantic Web and developed an application which allows its users to browse recipes based on leftovers they might have in their kitchen, ultimately reducing food waste.


[Data & Matrix](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10a75TzSMbRbXZJtyzNDduypMRhvqyRve?usp=sharing) (R) <br />
In these tasks, the practices of data analytical skills related to **Matrix Completion**, **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization**, and **Singular Value Decomposition** are built.
