   - "Throw-away society" is a term often used to describe today's society. The German center for nutrition estimates that every year eleven million tonnes of food is thrown away in Germany alone. For the U.S., the figures are even worse: 150,000 tonnes of food is thrown away every day.
   - The biggest reason why ingredients are thrown away is that the quantity initially bought exceeded the actually required quantity for a given period of time. This might be either because of a special promotion, the product not being available in smaller units or just due to a lack of planning for the purchase. One way to reduce some of that waste would be to provide a way to use leftover food.
   - In our project, we achieved just that! We build an API using Apache Jena providing households with an easy way to find recipes incorporating food they need to either consume today or throw away tomorrow. We tapped into the power of the Semantic Web and developed an application which allows its users to browse recipes based on leftovers they might have in their kitchen, ultimately reducing food waste.
   - Apache Jena, a Java framework, is a well-known Semantic Web programming framework. In this project, data knowledge related to **Linked Open Data** and **Ontology engineering** are applied.
