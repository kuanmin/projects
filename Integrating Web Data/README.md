 - [Integrating Web Data on Video Games and Companies](https://github.com/kuanmin/projects/tree/master/Integrating%20Web%20Data) (`Python`, `Java`, `XML` / *MapForce*) <br />
   - In this project, we worked with Python and Java libraries BeautifulSoup, Selenium WebDriver, and Jsoup3. And data analytical skills related to **Data Translation**, **Identity Resolution**, and **Data Fusion** are applied.
   - We focus on building an integrated database of video games and video game developers which will be informative to video game players and professionals working in the industry alike. Our combined data can offer interesting new visions that can assist on business decision making and drive video game businesses to a success. Simply by exploring and mining this data, one will be able to gain a better understanding of current video game trends. 
   - For example, our integrated data can provide answers on manifold questions such as ‘Which game platform currently generates the most revenue?’, ‘Which genre types are most popular among the users?’, ’How does game experts’ judgment affect the market sales‘, or ‘How does the revenue of games differ from the worldwide regions?’.
