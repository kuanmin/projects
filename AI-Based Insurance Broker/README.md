 - [AI-Based Insurance Broker](https://github.com/kuanmin/projects/tree/master/AI-Based%20Insurance%20Broker) (`Java`, `JSON`, `JavaScript`, *Java AWT*, *NetBeans*, *MongoDB*, *React*, *Flask*) <br />
   - In this project, data knowledge related to **Ontology engineering** and **Multiple-criteria decision analysis** are applied. 
   - We want to shed light onto the current technological state of the insurance broker industry and how AI may transform it. Furthermore, we provide an Recommender System for dental insurances using the **Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution** (TOPSIS), a popular **Multiple Criteria Decision Making Method** (MCDM). In addition we design an architectural model which may serve as an example of how to implement an insurance recommender system as a web application with state of the art technology.
